# Top 5 Microfrontend Hosting Solutions

Growing rapidly in recent years, microfrontends have become a critical solution for large software organizations. Hosting microfrontends has become a complicated, but crucial, aspect of scaling software organizations. Whether companies are using single-spa, module federation, or any other microfrontends tools, the management of CI/CD pipelines, deployments, CDNs, and service discovery is something all companies will have to solve.

## Server-side versus client-side rendering

This article focuses on hosting solutions for client-side rendered microfrontends, since the majority of microfrontend implementations rely solely on [client-side rendering](https://ferie.medium.com/what-is-the-client-side-rendering-and-how-it-works-c90210e2cd14).

[Server-side rendering](https://www.heavy.ai/technical-glossary/server-side-rendering) of microfrontends often involves one or more docker containers that run [NodeJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) to render [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(software)), [Angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)), or [Vue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js) applications. [Single-spa server rendering](/docs/ssr-overview) also supports a single NodeJS runtime (rather than network requests between docker containers), for optimal performance.

1. *Web apps hosting* refers to hosting the parent/root HTML file that initializes the microfrontends necessary for client-side rendering.
2. *Environment support* refers to hosting each microfrontend and web app on both internal test environments and live production environments. CI/CD Pipelines are configured to deploy to environments sequentially.
3. *Auto-generated CI pipelines* refers to generating configuration files for [Github workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows), [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines), [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) and other CI/CD tools.
4. *Route / layout management* refers to managing the in-browser URL routes and DOM layout for microfrontends.
5. *Self-owned assets storage* refers to JS, CSS, HTML, font, and image files being stored within a bucket owned by the company implementing microfrontends, rather than by cloud hosting service.
6. *Edge-side HTML rendering optimizations* refers to dynamically changing the HTML file for a web app via code that runs in [edge locations](https://www.macrometa.com/articles/what-is-edge-side-rendering). Since edge locations are physically closer to most users than an origin server, this provides maximum performance beneifts. Performance benefits include inlining import maps, `<link rel=preload>`, and `<script>` elements so that the browser begins downloading the necessary resources for the current URL as quickly as possible.
7. *Service discovery* refers to all available microfrontends easily cross-communicating with each other. This is often done via [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) or other manifest files.
8. *Full audit trail* refers to logs for all deployments, infrastructure changes, and configuration changes within the microfrontends system.
9. *Shared dependency management* refers to externalizing or federating shared npm packages between microfrontends, to improve performance by only downloading and executing the code for them once within a web page.
10. *Microfrontend marketplace* refers to purchasing or installing pre-made microfrontends into a company's system.
11. *Rolling deployments* refers to introducing new code changes to a microfrontend to only a fraction of the userbase, to minimize impact of releasing bad code.
